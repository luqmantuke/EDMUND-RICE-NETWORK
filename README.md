# EDMUND-RICE-NETWORK
My second project in web development, I really made a lot of progress apart from my first project.
The site is all about charity which is offered by my Secondary school called Edmund Rice Sinon Secondary.
I made this site within a week hoping to get paid and earn my first income from coding LOL. So i had to ask for a permision and come after it.
Apart from not getting what i expected i av really learnt alot and hoping to make more projects after im done with my studies this year 2020
