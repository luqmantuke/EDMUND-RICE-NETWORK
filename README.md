# EDMUND-RICE-NETWORK
My second project in web development i av not been making many projects and learning because of school. The school system in Tanzania is really broke, no computers in school for making projects that's why i do make projects during holidays, and that's affects me much because of not practising programming. I really made a lot of progress apart from my first project though didn't practice programming or learning new things for almost 3 months despite the fact that i am a beginner.
The site is all about charity which is offered by my Secondary school called Edmund Rice Sinon Secondary.
I made this site within a week hoping to get paid and earn my first income from coding LOL. So i had to ask for  permision and came home after it.
Apart from not getting what i expected i av really learnt alot and hoping to make more projects after im done with my studies this year 2020
